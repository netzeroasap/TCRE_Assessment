# TCRE_ASSESSMENT

**Bayesian analysis framework for TCRE Assessment**

## Overview

This repository provides a Bayesian analysis framework to support the assessment of the Transient Climate Response to cumulative carbon Emissions (TCRE). The TCRE is a key metric in climate science, used to estimate the relationship between cumulative CO₂ emissions and global temperature increase.

## Features

- Bayesian inference to estimate TCRE parameters
- Tools for processing climate model outputs and observational datasets
- Reproducible analysis workflows
- Visualization utilities for assessment and reporting

## Quick start
```
git clone https://github.com/netzeroasap/TCRE_Assessment.git
cd TCRE_Assessment
conda env create -f pymc_environment.yml
conda activate tcre
```
### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Recommended: [conda](https://docs.conda.io/) or [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for environment management


## Usage

Example scripts and Jupyter notebooks will be available in the `examples/` directory.
For right now use analysis.ipynb

```
jupyter lab notebooks/analysis.ipynb
```
