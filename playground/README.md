# Automatic data extraction

Something obvious that arises, given multiple working groups, papers, etc...,  is the general processing of data from several sources.

Ideally, we would like to process everything in the same formats to feed our priors (and eventually evidence).

## TODO

- [x] Simple wrapper that allows extraction of data from Zechlau et al. 2022 Table, without manual tweaking
- [ ] Deciding which format to use. Not all sources will have same variables, or distributions for each. 
- [ ] We also would like to play with distributions. Note sure of to handle this here. But it seems natural to define a pdf with properties given by tables
- [ ] Automatic evidence processing.
